# TeeDesign
This was a t-shirt design I created for my schools annual East v. West game. One of the solgans of the Student Section has been "Roll Cougs" going along with our mascot, a cougar. I thought the idea of a steam roller rolling over a whippet (opposing mascot) would be funny, even if a little dark.
